# Blob-Detection_Computer-Vision
Î•xercise working with blob detection algorithm.   
The blob detection algorithm aims to identify regions in a digital image that differ in properties, such as brightness or color, 
compared to the surrounding pixels of the image.   
Defining a blob involves identifying a region of the image where certain properties are constant or approximately constant.
All the points within the blob can be considered similar in some sense, and this detection is achieved through convolution.
